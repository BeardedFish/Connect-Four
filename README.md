# Connect-Four

Connect Four is a classic two-player game where the objective for a player is to be the first one to form four of their game chips in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. There are 3 outcomes that can occur in this game, player 1 (red) wins, player 2 (yellow) wins, or the game ends in a tie. You can read more about Connect Four [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).
